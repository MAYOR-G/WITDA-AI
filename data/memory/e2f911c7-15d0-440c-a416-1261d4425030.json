    "content": "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, an AI framework designed to improve the quality of responses from large language models (LLMs). It works by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating a response.\n\nHere's how it generally works:\n1.  **Retrieval:** When a user poses a question, the system first searches a private or external data source (like documents, databases, or web pages) for relevant information.\n2.  **Augmentation:** The retrieved information is then provided to the LLM alongside the original user query.\n3.  **Generation:** The LLM uses this augmented context to generate a more accurate, informed, and up-to-date response, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and leveraging specific, non-training data.",
