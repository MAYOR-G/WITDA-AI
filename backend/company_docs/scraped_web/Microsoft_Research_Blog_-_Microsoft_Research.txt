BlueCodeAgent: A blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming for CodeGen AI November 11, 2025 BlueCodeAgent is an end-to-end blue-teaming framework built to boost code security using automated red-teaming processes, data, and safety rules to guide LLMs’ defensive decisions. Dynamic testing reduces false positives in vulnerability detection. When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost November 6, 2025 | Industry Innovation Center A collaboration between Signify and Microsoft Research shows how PIKE-RAG improves enterprise knowledge systems, delivering a 12% increase in accuracy and faster, more reliable answers. Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets November 5, 2025 AI agents are poised to transform digital marketplaces. To explore what can happen when AI agents interact and transact at scale, we built Magentic Marketplace, an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic market designs. RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents November 4, 2025 Code agents help streamline software development workflows, but may also introduce critical security risks. Learn how RedCodeAgent automates and improves “red-teaming” attack simulations to help uncover real-world threats that other methods overlook. Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act October 21, 2025 SentinelStep enables AI agents to handle monitoring tasks that run for hours or days, like watching for emails or tracking prices. It works by managing when agents should check and their context, avoiding wasted resources and missed updates. When AI Meets Biology: Promise, Risk, and Responsibility October 6, 2025 | Eric Horvitz Microsoft researchers reveal a confidential research effort that explored how open-source AI tools could be used to bypass biosecurity checks—and helped create fixes now influencing global standards. Using AI to assist in rare disease diagnosis September 22, 2025 | Mandi Hall and Ashley Conard New research from Microsoft, Drexel, and the Broad explores how generative AI could support genetic professionals in rare disease diagnosis. Tool-space interference in the MCP era: Designing for agent compatibility at scale September 11, 2025 | Adam Fourney , Tyler Payne , Maya Murad , and Saleema Amershi As agentic AI ushers in a new era marked by tool expansion, systems are converging, and complexity is rising. Microsoft Research explores the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a new standard for agent collaboration across fragmented tool ecosystems. RenderFormer: How neural networks are reshaping 3D rendering September 10, 2025 | Yue Dong RenderFormer, from Microsoft Research, is the first model to show that a neural network can learn a complete graphics rendering pipeline. It’s designed to support full-featured 3D rendering using only machine learning—no traditional graphics computation required. Breaking the networking wall in AI infrastructure September 9, 2025 | Paolo Costa Datacenter memory and network limits are restraining AI system performance. MOSAIC uses microLEDs and a wide-and-slow optical architecture to deliver faster, longer, more reliable, and energy efficient connections that could transform AI cluster designs. Crescent library brings privacy to digital identity systems August 26, 2025 | Christian Paquin and Greg Zaverucha Crescent helps make digital IDs private by preventing tracking across uses while letting users only disclose what’s necessary from their credentials.
